# Habitap

See our deployed app here - https://habitap.vercel.app/

## Description

A simple yet engaging habit tracking app that helps people build new and better habits in a fun, social and trackable way, without distracting from what’s important.

## MVP

- A mobile-first app that uses plant growth to display the user’s progress with their habit that will include:
- A clean, non-distracting UI that has good accessibility.
- The ability to create, read, update and delete to-dos.
- Track progress over time with a monthly score which reflects on the size of a plant - the higher the score, the more developed your plant is.
- Ability to share progress on social media.
