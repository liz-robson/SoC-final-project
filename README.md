# Habitap

See our deployed app here - https://habitap.vercel.app/

## Description

Habitap turns goal-setting into a rewarding, fun and collaborative journey. Focus on up to five habits that truly matter, check in daily for just a couple of minutes to update your progress, and witness your virtual plant flourish. No cluttered menus, no endless notifications, just a simple interface that celebrates every small step towards your goal. Share with your friends, cheer each other on, and watch your collective garden grow. 


## MVP

- A mobile-first app that uses plant growth to display the userâ€™s progress with their habit that will include:
- A clean, non-distracting UI that has good accessibility.
- The ability to create, read, update and delete to-dos.
- Track progress over time with a monthly score which reflects on the size of a plant - the higher the score, the more developed your plant is.
- Ability to share progress on social media.
